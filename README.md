## 📖 Overview
This project presents the **conceptual design** of a **four‑gear compound gearbox** in SOLIDWORKS, developed to lift a **1 kg mass up a 50 cm, 45° ramp**.  
A **static stress analysis** was conducted to optimize material usage while ensuring structural integrity under load.

Key features:
- **Four‑gear compound configuration** for efficient torque transmission
- **Stress‑optimized design** to minimize weight without compromising strength
- **Detailed CAD modeling** with precise tolerances
- **Static analysis** to validate safety factors and material selection
